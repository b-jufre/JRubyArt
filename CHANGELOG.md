**v1.0.3** Build now using processing-3.0.1 core and matching video jars from maven central and pom.rb build file (polyglot maven), furthermore using maven-wrapper so maven version isn't even required see mvnw and mvwm.bat and .mvn/maven-wrapper.properties. The pom.xml is not needed but included for completness.

**v1.0.2** Various cleanups, favoring SHA256 over SHA1 to check jruby-complete

**v1.0.1** Using jruby-complete-9.0.4.0, features reworked extension build using maven

**v1.0.0** Using jruby-complete-9.0.3.0 (no 9.0.2.0 owing to snafu at jruby.org) use github.io for home. Re-factor boids to use Vec3D, Vec2D and keyword arguments.
**v0.9.0** Require processing-3.0.

**v0.8.0** Require processing-3.0b7 and using jruby-9.0.1.0 replaced spec tests with minitest.

**v0.7.0** Require processing-3.0b6 and using jruby-9.0.1.0 added a Gemfile for bundler fans, but I'm not sure how well it can work with the required compile step. Statically load JRubyArt jruby extensions. features `on_top` to keep display on top of course (implements `surface.setAlwaysOnTop(true);`).

**v0.6.0** Tested processing-3.0b5 and using jruby-9.0.1.0 getting nearer processing release, `AABB` is now `AaBb` which avoids clashing with toxigem

**v0.5.0** Tested with processing-3.0b4 more samples included, introducing `keyword` args and a 2D `AABB` implementation
map1d, lerp, norm, p5map and `constrained_map` as module methods in a JRuby extension. Using jdk-8 source for lambda...

**v0.4.2** Tested with processing-3.0b2 color helper method refactored to use a jruby extension

**v0.4.1** Implement a `live` mode with `pry`


**v0.4.0** Update to jruby-9.0.0.0 we can revert to using require to load jars first release tested with processing-3.0a11 on linux

**v0.3.1** Update to jruby-complete-9.0.0.0.rc2, add vector type access to Vec2D and Vec3D parameters eg `vector[:x]` to return 'x' value,  and `vector[:x] = 20` to assign value (also simplify the return type of assignment as input value).

**v0.3.0** Revert to similar architecture as ruby-processing-2.6.12, including changes that make jruby and PApplet use same classloader.  This change is required for JRuby-9.0.0.0 compatibility. Other changes include:- load `rpextras.jar` early (so it only get loaded once) and loading the `vecmath` and `fastmath` libraries by default.
